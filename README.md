# SemanticWorld: LLM-Based RAG System with Elasticsearch & OpenSearch

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the integration of a Large Language Model (LLM) with Elasticsearch and OpenSearch to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This innovative approach combines the power of advanced natural language understanding with efficient data retrieval capabilities.

## Features
- **LLM Integration**: Leverages a state-of-the-art Language Model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Elasticsearch & OpenSearch**: Utilizes Elasticsearch and OpenSearch as vector databases for efficient data indexing and retrieval.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to be scalable and efficient, suitable for handling large datasets.
